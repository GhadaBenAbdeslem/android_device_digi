     Edited the android:state_focused="true" drawable from "@drawable/list_focused_holo"
     to "@color/transparent" to avoid an ugly blue overlay on UI elements when mouse is
     connected and element is focused using the holo dark theme.

     https://jira.digi.com/browse/ADK4A-1621

     To revert the change just remove this file.
